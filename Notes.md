Build modules: 
1. Build a module to visualize each item with sliders 
2. 1 module is to embed the little game thing with sliders 
3. how to have the graphs generated after each move in the behavior 
4. have the graphs gravitate to fixed points in the system and to "stick" 
5. ~~draw the path of 1 item~~
6. how to have the graphs contain lines and stable points/fixed points 
7. apprearing + dissapearing texts explaining what is happening in the simulation 

~ 




Basic Strategies: 
1. fixed points 
2. attracting and repelling points 
3. stable points 

# use romeo and juliet as an example 
# this is relatively easy: 
# belle and beast. Belle loves people who hates her because of stockholm sydrome, while beast likes whoever likes him back. 
# romeo and juliet, they love people who hate them
